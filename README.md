# OP-on-SG

This repository contains entirely python code used to construct, analyze, and visualize Sobolev Orthogonal Polynomials on the Sierpinski Gasket. This code was primarily used in our research during the VERISEM-REU at Tufts University.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

The following python libraries (in addition to the standard library) are required to use this package:

* numpy
* scipy
* sympy
* gmpy2
* tqdm



### Usage

The ops_main.py file contains the code used to generate the orthogonal polynomials. The monomials.py file and plotting.py
file can be used to plot the polynomials on SG.
